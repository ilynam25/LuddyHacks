 	 	 	 	 watching lecture videos [~ 4-5 hours], completing the
 	 	 	 	 assigned readings, and completing any quizzes or
 	 	 	 	 assignments. Remember that this is a 6-week condensed course
 	 	 	 	 - submissions will be required at regular intervals (for

 	 	 	 	 learning classes where students will engage in

 	 	 	 	 review the previous week's lecture material. Students are
