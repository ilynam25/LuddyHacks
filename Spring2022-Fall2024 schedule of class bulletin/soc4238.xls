 	 	 	 	 The structure of the above class is flipped relative to that
 	 	 	 	 of a traditional class. There will be one interactive online
 	 	 	 	 class meeting per week. Before each class, students will
 	 	 	 	 view recorded lecture videos, complete lecture quizzes, read
 	 	 	 	 the textbook and work on textbook-related online activities.
 	 	 	 	 Weekly class time is used for collaborative, active, and
 	 	 	 	 inquiry-based activities designed to deepen understanding of
 	 	 	 	 course topics and to provide practice in disciplinary
 	 	 	 	 thinking (e.g., visualizing biological processes, making
 	 	 	 	 predictions, drawing conclusions from data, and reading and
 	 	 	 	 analyzing scientific publications).

 	 	 	 	 In a highly interactive, small-group setting, explore and
 	 	 	 	 practice evidence-based mind-body techniques useful for
 	 	 	 	 intentionally connecting with your mind and body; regulating
 	 	 	 	 your autonomic nervous system(responsible for the "fight or
 	 	 	 	 flight" response); and tapping into your internal wisdom.
 	 	 	 	 Skills we will explore include: meditation (concentrative,
 	 	 	 	 expressive, and mindfulness), visualization, imagery, body
 	 	 	 	 scans, and more. No experience with the use of these skills
 	 	 	 	 is necessary. Come as you are, ready to learn about how
 	 	 	 	 these skills can be a valuable component of your personal
 	 	 	 	 wellness and self-care hygiene routine.
