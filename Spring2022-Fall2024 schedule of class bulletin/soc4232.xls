 	 	 C117 that is intended for students who plan to continue to organic
 	 	 chemistry or other later courses in chemistry and would benefit from
 	 	 a smaller, more structured section. The course will use a
 	 	 specifications-based grading scheme in which students will get credit
 	 	 for showing mastery of core and advanced topics, and the final grade
 	 	 will be determined by the number of topics students master. Students
 	 	 will be asked to commit to being a part of a supportive and
 	 	 respectful learning community, to attending at least one office hour
 	 	 per week at any point that they are struggling, and to submitting
 	 	 work that accurately reflects their understanding of the material.

 	 	 	 	 EVOLUTION AND ANALYSIS OF BRAIN-BODY-ENVIRONMENT SYSTEMS
 	 	 	 	 Notions of embodiment, situatedness and dynamics are
 	 	 	 	 becoming increasingly important in cognitive science,
 	 	 	 	 converging on a view in which an agent's behavior and
 	 	 	 	 cognition are seen not merely as products of its brain
 	 	 	 	 alone, but rather as arising from the interaction between
 	 	 	 	 the agent's nervous system, body and environment. In order
 	 	 	 	 to evaluate the significance of these ideas, this course
 	 	 	 	 will examine the construction and analysis of models of
 	 	 	 	 complete brain-body-environment systems, with a particular
 	 	 	 	 emphasis on the use of tools from complex systems (including
 	 	 	 	 evolutionary algorithms, dynamical systems theory and
 	 	 	 	 information theory) to study how such coupled systems work.
 	 	 	 	 Behaviors to be examined range from basic motor behavior and
 	 	 	 	 sensorimotor learning to categorical perception, selective
 	 	 	 	 attention, agency detection and communication. We will also
 	 	 	 	 examine some of the broader implications of the
 	 	 	 	 brain-body-environment perspective for thinking about brain
 	 	 	 	 and behavior.

 	 	 	 	 This practicum is geared toward students interested in a
 	 	 	 	 career in brand management or as a creative service provider
 	 	 	 	 for brands. The course offers students the opportunity to
 	 	 	 	 work on a real brand (preferably national) with teammates
 	 	 	 	 who offer a variety of expertise including strategy, design,
 	 	 	 	 and media. Students from the Kelley School of Business, The
 	 	 	 	 Media School, and the Eskenazi School of Art, Architecture +
 	 	 	 	 Design are encouraged to enroll. This team composition
 	 	 	 	 mimics what students will experience in their future jobs
 	 	 	 	 and hence, prepares them to see a business problem from a
 	 	 	 	 different lens and appreciate the diversity of views. This
 	 	 	 	 course provides students with a unique learning experience
 	 	 	 	 of applying the synergy of different talents, knowledge,
 	 	 	 	 skills, and perspectives to create effective strategies,
 	 	 	 	 tactics, and deliverables for a brand that can be
 	 	 	 	 implemented in the real world.   Application is required for

 	 	 	 	 TOPIC : Tackling Test Anxiety
 	 	 	 	 Are you dreading an upcoming test?  Do you blank out or have
 	 	 	 	 trouble focusing every time you take a big exam?  Are you
 	 	 	 	 frustrated because you consistently find that your scores
 	 	 	 	 dont match what you feel you really know?  Preparing for an
 	 	 	 	 important professional school entrance exam  the MCAT,
 	 	 	 	 LSAT, etc.?
 	 	 	 	 This course is all about evidence-backed strategies for
 	 	 	 	 taking your anxiety level way down for any kind of test 
 	 	 	 	 whether that be for professional school entrance exams or
 	 	 	 	 finals in your most difficult courses.
 	 	 	 	 Our approach centers on how to 1) apply the science of
 	 	 	 	 powerful learning to better prepare for important tests; 2)
 	 	 	 	 create effective schedules and habits for studying so it
 	 	 	 	 sticks; and 3) transform the emotions that come up before,
 	 	 	 	 during, and after the test to achieve your performance and
 	 	 	 	 professional goals.

 	 	 	 	 Above class meets with SPEA-V 550
 	 	 	 	 According to Jonathan Rosenberg, former senior vice
 	 	 	 	 president of Google, Data is the sword of the 21st century,
 	 	 	 	 those who wield it well, the Samurai. In recent decades,
 	 	 	 	 survey data have become powerful swords that inform
 	 	 	 	 government policy making, business and nonprofit
 	 	 	 	 decision-making, political campaigns, legal decisions, and
 	 	 	 	 academic research in many fields of study. This course will
 	 	 	 	 give you the skills that you will need to harness the power
 	 	 	 	 of surveys: How do I select a sample? How do I design survey
 	 	 	 	 questions? How do I collect the data? As part of the class,
 	 	 	 	 students will be exposed to many real world survey examples.
 	 	 	 	 This is a rigorous, upper-level undergraduate class designed
 	 	 	 	 for those with an interest in research methods.

 	 	 	 	 Modern social, political and environmental problems must
 	 	 	 	 confront several difficulties in arriving at acceptable,
 	 	 	 	 robust and resilient solutions.  These difficulties include
 	 	 	 	 uncertainty, how time affects important decisions and
 	 	 	 	 outcomes, complexity (the real world has lots of variables),
 	 	 	 	 and potentially reactive behaviors leading to unintended
 	 	 	 	 consequences.  Using optimization methods and simulation,
 	 	 	 	 this course cover topics from problem formulation to
