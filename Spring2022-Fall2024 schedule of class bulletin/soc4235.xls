 	 	 	 	 collaborative, active, and inquiry-based activities meant to
 	 	 	 	 deepen your understanding of course topics and to provide
 	 	 	 	 practice in disciplinary thinking (e.g., visualizing
 	 	 	 	 biological processes, making predictions, drawing
 	 	 	 	 conclusions from data, and reading and analyzing scientific
 	 	 	 	 publications). Because students learn and retain information
 	 	 	 	 best when they are actively engaged during class, the
 	 	 	 	 structure of this course is flipped relative to that of a
 	 	 	 	 traditional classroom. There will be two, highly
 	 	 	 	 interactive, required class meetings per week. Before each
 	 	 	 	 class, you will view recorded lectures, participate on
 	 	 	 	 Canvas discussion board, read textbook and complete
 	 	 	 	 textbook-related online activities. Your out-of-class
 	 	 	 	 studies will be guided by video outlines and/or question
 	 	 	 	 banks. Our weekly two-hour sessions will include individual
 	 	 	 	 quizzes, team-based quizzes, team-based activities, and
