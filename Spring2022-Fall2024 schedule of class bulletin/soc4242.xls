 	 	 	 	 The goals of this course are to provide a fundamental
 	 	 	 	 understanding of virus structure and function, and to
 	 	 	 	 strengthen critical thinking skills of students.   The
 	 	 	 	 course will examine key concepts in structural virology,
 	 	 	 	 focusing on the molecular mechanisms underlying viral
 	 	 	 	 replication. We will follow the replication cycle of
 	 	 	 	 viruses, including virus structure, virus attachment and
 	 	 	 	 cell entry, protein expression and genome replication, and
 	 	 	 	 assembly and release of virus particles.  The content will
 	 	 	 	 include a combination of PowerPoint presentations and
 	 	 	 	 discussion of primary research papers.

 	 	 	 	 The purpose of this course is for the student to develop an
 	 	 	 	 understanding of the principles of electron microscopy as
 	 	 	 	 applied to the study of biological macromolecules and
 	 	 	 	 tissues.  Knowledge of these principles will form a
 	 	 	 	 foundation for gaining practical experience and training in
 	 	 	 	 biological electron microscopy. At the completion of this
 	 	 	 	 course, participants will have become skilled in applying
 	 	 	 	 some of the techniques and concepts necessary to
 	 	 	 	 independently initiate projects on quantitative protein
 	 	 	 	 unfolding/folding, protein-ligand binding, protein size
 	 	 	 	 distribution, protein secondary and tertiary structure, or
 	 	 	 	 any number of other quantitative biophysics applications.

 	 	 	 	 EVOLUTION AND ANALYSIS OF BRAIN-BODY-ENVIRONMENT SYSTEMS
 	 	 	 	 Notions of embodiment, situatedness and dynamics are
 	 	 	 	 becoming increasingly important in cognitive science,
 	 	 	 	 converging on a view in which an agent's behavior and
 	 	 	 	 cognition are seen not merely as products of its brain
 	 	 	 	 alone, but rather as arising from the interaction between
 	 	 	 	 the agent's nervous system, body and environment. In order
 	 	 	 	 to evaluate the significance of these ideas, this course
 	 	 	 	 will examine the construction and analysis of models of
 	 	 	 	 complete brain-body-environment systems, with a particular
 	 	 	 	 emphasis on the use of tools from complex systems (including
 	 	 	 	 evolutionary algorithms, dynamical systems theory and
 	 	 	 	 information theory) to study how such coupled systems work.
 	 	 	 	 Behaviors to be examined range from basic motor behavior and
 	 	 	 	 sensorimotor learning to categorical perception, selective
 	 	 	 	 attention, agency detection and communication. We will also
 	 	 	 	 examine some of the broader implications of the
 	 	 	 	 brain-body-environment perspective for thinking about brain
 	 	 	 	 and behavior.

 	 	 	 	 career in brand management or as a creative service provider
 	 	 	 	 for brands. The course offers students the opportunity to
 	 	 	 	 work on a real brand (preferably national) with teammates
 	 	 	 	 who offer a variety of expertise including strategy, design,
 	 	 	 	 and media. Students from the Kelley School of Business, The
 	 	 	 	 Media School, and the Eskenazi School of Art, Architecture +
 	 	 	 	 Design are encouraged to enroll. This team composition
 	 	 	 	 mimics what students will experience in their future jobs
 	 	 	 	 and hence, prepares them to see a business problem from a
 	 	 	 	 different lens and appreciate the diversity of views. This
 	 	 	 	 course provides students with a unique learning experience
 	 	 	 	 of applying the synergy of different talents, knowledge,
 	 	 	 	 skills, and perspectives to create effective strategies,
 	 	 	 	 tactics, and deliverables for a brand that can be

 	 	 	 	 In this course, students will begin to explore the personal,

 	 	 	 	 the lived experience of being a professional teacher
 	 	 	 	 Possible key questions for reflection include: How does
 	 	 	 	 self-knowledge help teachers positively shape their
 	 	 	 	 professional lives? How does school culture shape the
 	 	 	 	 day-to-day life of teachers and how do you identify a school
 	 	 	 	 culture that is right for you? How does the current emphasis
 	 	 	 	 on standardized testing impact the life of a teacher and how
 	 	 	 	 can teachers positively respond to this? What does it mean
 	 	 	 	 to be a "role model" and what are the challenges and
 	 	 	 	 opportunities presented by this social role? What does
 	 	 	 	 community mean and how are teachers participants in and

 	 	 	 	 TOPIC : Tackling Test Anxiety
 	 	 	 	 Are you dreading an upcoming test?  Do you blank out or have
 	 	 	 	 trouble focusing every time you take a big exam?  Are you
 	 	 	 	 frustrated because you consistently find that your scores
 	 	 	 	 dont match what you feel you really know?  Preparing for an
 	 	 	 	 important professional school entrance exam  the MCAT,
 	 	 	 	 LSAT, etc.?
 	 	 	 	 This course is all about evidence-backed strategies for
 	 	 	 	 taking your anxiety level way down for any kind of test 
 	 	 	 	 whether that be for professional school entrance exams or
 	 	 	 	 finals in your most difficult courses.
 	 	 	 	 Our approach centers on how to 1) apply the science of
 	 	 	 	 powerful learning to better prepare for important tests; 2)
 	 	 	 	 create effective schedules and habits for studying so it
 	 	 	 	 sticks; and 3) transform the emotions that come up before,
 	 	 	 	 during, and after the test to achieve your performance and
 	 	 	 	 professional goals.

 	 	 	 	 Above class meets with SPEA-V 550
 	 	 	 	 According to Jonathan Rosenberg, former senior vice
 	 	 	 	 president of Google, Data is the sword of the 21st century,
 	 	 	 	 those who wield it well, the Samurai. In recent decades,
 	 	 	 	 survey data have become powerful swords that inform
 	 	 	 	 government policy making, business and nonprofit
 	 	 	 	 decision-making, political campaigns, legal decisions, and
 	 	 	 	 academic research in many fields of study. This course will
 	 	 	 	 give you the skills that you will need to harness the power
 	 	 	 	 of surveys: How do I select a sample? How do I design survey
 	 	 	 	 questions? How do I collect the data? As part of the class,
 	 	 	 	 students will be exposed to many real world survey examples.
 	 	 	 	 This is a rigorous, upper-level undergraduate class designed
 	 	 	 	 for those with an interest in research methods.
