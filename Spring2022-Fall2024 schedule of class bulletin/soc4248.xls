 	 	 	 	 This course is designed to understand how and why cell
 	 	 	 	 biology is key to understanding and unlocking many aspects
 	 	 	 	 of human biology and evolution of life in all its forms.
 	 	 	 	 There is an emphasis on eukaryotic organisms. We will focus
 	 	 	 	 on the structure, function and biosynthesis of cellular
 	 	 	 	 membranes and organelles; protein transport and modification
 	 	 	 	 in the cell; the cytoskeleton; cell signaling, cell growth,
 	 	 	 	 cell death* and how they are impacted in disease states via
 	 	 	 	 Bench to Bedside lectures.   The focus of the course is to
 	 	 	 	 learn cell biology while engaging in core scientific
 	 	 	 	 practices essential for a biology major and for success in
 	 	 	 	 your future professional goals.   For those, whose future
 	 	 	 	 goals involves healthcare the premed competencies as
 	 	 	 	 defined by American Association of Medical Colleges we will
 	 	 	 	 engage in are  Scientific Inquiry. Applies knowledge of the
 	 	 	 	 scientific process to integrate and synthesize information,
 	 	 	 	 solve problems, and formulate research questions and
 	 	 	 	 hypotheses; is facile in the language of the sciences and
 	 	 	 	 uses it to participate in the discourse of science and
 	 	 	 	 explain how scientific knowledge is discovered and
 	 	 	 	 validated and Written Communication. Effectively conveys
 	 	 	 	 information to others by using written words and sentences.
 	 	 	 	 Note: To achieve the objectives above this class uses a
 	 	 	 	 flipped format where class time will be used through
 	 	 	 	 active learning, learning how to deconstruct a paper using a
 	 	 	 	 method called C.R.E.A.T.E (see here:
 	 	 	 	 https://iu.mediaspace.kaltura.com/media/t/1_iyonp779) , and
 	 	 	 	 exploring the connection between Cell Biology and medicine
 	 	 	 	 through Bench to Bedside activities.  Students will not be
 	 	 	 	 getting a traditional lecture in class! You will be expected
 	 	 	 	 to complete assigned readings/videos before class.

 	 	 	 	 Possible key questions for reflection include: How does
 	 	 	 	 self-knowledge help teachers positively shape their
 	 	 	 	 professional lives? How does school culture shape the
 	 	 	 	 day-to-day life of teachers and how do you identify a school
 	 	 	 	 culture that is right for you?  How does the current
 	 	 	 	 emphasis on standardized testing impact the life of a
 	 	 	 	 teacher and how can teachers positively respond to this?
 	 	 	 	 What does it mean to be a role model and what are the
 	 	 	 	 challenges and opportunities presented by this social role?
 	 	 	 	 What does community mean and how are teachers participants
 	 	 	 	 in and facilitators of positive community? Exploration of
